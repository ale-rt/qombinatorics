To install qombinatorics version x.y.z from sources:
    $ tar xjf qombinatorcis-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    $ cd pyxcom
if needed become root:
    $ su -
and then install:
    $ python setup.py install
or (if you want to install under another directory)
    $ python setup.py install --prefix=<dir>

MAKE an RPM package
If you installed tools to build rpm packages just run the following line
of code:
    $ python setup.py bdist --formats=rpm

An rpm and a srpm will be created in the directory "./dist"
The install them as usual: rpm -ivh path/name.rpm
or upgrade: rpm -Uvh path/name.rpm
